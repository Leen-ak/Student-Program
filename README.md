Student Program

This project is a Java application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for students to view their academic transcripts. It includes multiple classes to handle different functionalities:

StudentLogin class: Allows users to log in to the program using their student ID and password.
StudentInformation class: Enables users to enter their general information such as name, gender, date of birth, address, phone number, and email.
GPACalculator class: Allows users to calculate their GPA based on their course grades and credits, including options to calculate GPA or Cumulative GPA.
TranscriptClass class: Displays a summary of student information, including their name, GPA, and academic standing, with a table listing course names, credits, and grades.
This project demonstrates my learning from two terms at Fanshawe College, covering GUI interfaces, file reading and writing, and input validation.
